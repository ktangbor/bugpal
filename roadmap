Implement CRUD Operations:
Start writing the CRUD logic in crud.py. This will include:

Creating issues.

Submitting fixes.

Upvoting/downvoting.

Create Business Logic:
Services in services.py will handle things like:

User reputation management.

Fix matchmaking based on relevance or popularity.

State transitions (Open → In Progress → Solved).

Setup Background Tasks:
Implement notification handling using FastAPI’s background tasks or Celery for tasks like:

Notify users when a fix is posted.

Notify when an issue reaches a solved state.

Design Patterns:
As you progress, incorporate design patterns:

Factory Pattern to create different types of fixes.

Observer Pattern for notifications.

Strategy Pattern for varying matching algorithms.

Repository Pattern for clean database access.

Testing:
Write tests in the tests/ directory. Make sure to cover:

User registration.

Issue posting.

Fix proposal and voting.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Approximate Timeline for BugPal:
Day 1: Project Setup (Poetry, FastAPI, Folder Structure)
Set up FastAPI, Poetry, and the base structure.

Implement the basic health check route.

Initialize version control and standard dev tools (black, isort, pytest).

Time Estimate: 1 day

Day 2: Database Configuration, Alembic, and Basic Models
Set up SQLAlchemy models (User, Issue, etc.).

Configure Alembic for migrations.

Implement the database session management and dependency injection.

Create a couple of simple CRUD endpoints (like POST for user creation).

Time Estimate: 1 day

Day 3: Core Features (CRUD for Issues, Fixes, and Voting)
Implement the CRUD operations for issues and fixes.

Set up relationships between issues and fixes, and create endpoints to post fixes.

Implement voting for fixes.

Focus on making the code modular (use design patterns like Repository, Strategy, etc.).

Time Estimate: 2 days

Day 4: User Management, Reputation, and Authentication
Add user registration and authentication (JWT token).

Implement user reputation logic (users earn reputation for posting fixes, etc.).

Create routes for user profile, reputation, and authentication.

Time Estimate: 2 days

Day 5: Background Tasks and Notifications
Implement background tasks for sending notifications (using FastAPI background tasks or Celery).

Set up email or push notifications for new fixes, issue updates, and votes.

Time Estimate: 1 day

Day 6: Admin Panel and Moderation
Create an admin panel with routes for moderating user activity.

Implement features like flagging inappropriate content and banning users.

Admins should also be able to mark issues as "solved."

Time Estimate: 1 day

Day 7: Testing, Documentation, and Cleanup
Write comprehensive tests for routes, models, and background tasks.

Ensure that the app is well-documented with OpenAPI.

Refactor code for clarity and modularity.

Time Estimate: 1–2 days

Total Estimate: 8–10 days
